# Covid-19
A (very) early project on Covid-19 data in Peru.

Currently, it shows -through a streamlit dashboard- data on confirmed cases and deaths nationwide and by regions in Peru.

# What's next
The very near roadmap includes implementing new information on hospitalizations and vaccionation in Peru as well as more granular data to the provincial and district level.

# Instructions
First, you need to run both ipynb files (positivos covid-19.ipynb and fallecidos covid-19.ipynb) to update the daily data. Open a Powershell prompt from your anaconda installation and go to the folder where the dashboard file is located. Then run the following:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
# Source
All data is taken from the open data repository of the Peruvian Government.
