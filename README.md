# Covid-19
A (very) early project on Covid-19 data in Peru.

Currently, it shows an streamlit dashboard with data on confirmed cases and deaths nationwide and by regions in Peru.

The very near roadmap includes implementing new information on hospitalizations and vaccionation in Peru as well as more granular data to the provincial and district level.

# Instructions
Just run the dashboard.py as a streamlit app through Powershell prompt in Anaconda. You can use the python projects (positivos y fallecidos) to update the data daily.

# Source
All data is taken from the open data repository of the Peruvian Government.
